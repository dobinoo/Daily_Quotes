## Hello there

This is a simple python/shell script to gather a daily quote from ```brainyquote.com```

### Requirements:

- only python (should work for any version of python, but if it doesn't work try download latest version)
- you need (obviously) internet connection
- None other things required
- None installation required
- JUST "python quote.py" :)
- if you still get some errors try to check if website isn't down ```ping brainyquote.com```

### INFO
